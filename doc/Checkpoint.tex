\section{Group Organisation}


\-\hspace{1cm}On the 30th of May, our group had an initial offline meeting to discuss how to split up the work. We decided that it would be best for each individual to work on one or two instructions so Mithun was assigned the {\bf Single Data Transfer Instrution}; {\bf Branch / Multiply Instruction} was given to Devin; Shewta and Taeho, responsible for the {\bf Data Processing Instruction}. This was to ensure everyone had fair amount of workload. \\
\-\hspace{1cm}We then discussed the data types that would be best suitable for registers, memory, instructions, etc. \\
\-\hspace{1cm}After completing the work we were assigned, we met again offline to put out implementation together.
\-\hspace{1cm}Our group is having regular meetings via Teams, constantly checking our individual progress to ensure that no one is falling behind and everyone is on track. We also created a group chat as mean of communication, where we frequently ask questions if we are unsure of how to implement certain functionalities or if we don't understand parts of the specification. So far, we have helped and learned a lot from each other.\\
\-\hspace{1cm}For the styling convention, we first thought of using the style 
\-\hspace{1cm}Although, as a team, we are working quite effectively and efficiently, we could definitely make some improvements for the remaining part of the C Group Project. Below are our thoughts on how our team can improve in the future.
